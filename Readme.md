# DESKTOP Journal and playbook

## In order to be able to track my steps through a full installation a configuration of a workstation

What I want with this is actualy a sort of playbook with all the software installed and specific
configurations that I did to my desktop/notebook so I can quickly replay those actions on another sys    tem

## Examples

- Java installation
- Flash installation
- Installing a new trusted root certificate
- Installing specific Gnome extensions
- All the little things that once installed become part of my daily habbits using them

For windows systems this is not necessarily needed because I can keep a folder structure with all the    
tools I need to install, a folder structure that if kept well organized and documented will be enough    .
In case of linux systems is not allways about installing a software, and even if it is about installi    ng
a package most of the installations are done from repository, so I will keep a repository like this w    ith
text lists of packages and instructions about how to do things.
